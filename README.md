# Living Curtains

This project aims to build a automation system for curtains. It might
seems silly at first, but, can be very interesting to have automated curtains.
It can help you wake up more naturally in the morning, letting slowly the sun
light come in the bed room. But it can also help to maintain the room
temperature and save energy, on summer it can automatically close the curtains
during the day, to avoid making the ambient too hot, and open it at night,
letting the room cool, and the process is inverted in the winter. And many other
applications, like [insert your idea here].

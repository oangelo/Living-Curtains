# Living Curtains

This project aims to build a automation system for curtains. It might
seems silly at first, but, can be very interesting to have automated curtains.
It can help you wake up more naturally in the morning, letting slowly the sun
light come in the bed room. But it can also help to maintain the room
temperature and save energy, on summer it can automatically close the curtains
during the day, to avoid making the ambient too hot, and open it at night,
letting the room cool, and the process is inverted in the winter. And many other
applications, like [insert your idea here].

# Foreword

Probably the most challenging part of any automation project is the mechanical
part, while electronics are advancing and right now is quite simple and cheap to
prototype simple projects like this one, mechanical parts demands space and
heavy tools that are expensive, and many skills that are no easy to obtain on
the internet. So, one should balance cost, accessibility and easiness to mount
of the mechanical parts. To make things easy, this project uses parts typically
found in 3D printers, they are not much cheap but are easy to find in the
internet and of easy assembly.

# Mounting

I am still working on the overall mechanics, but this is how it looks now.
